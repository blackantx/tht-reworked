!!!!!WARNINGS!!!!!!

This release of THT Reworked revises several things.  Please keep the following in mind when upgrading.

1.) Review all of your settings in "General Settings" many items were moved there and are now default.
2.) If you do P2H hosting, you need to re-add your forums in the config.  The P2H now has it's own table.
3.) If you modified any of your email templates, be sure to back those up.  When you're finished, you'll need to re-enter the subject and the text for them.
4.) You and your clients must reset your password due to the heightened security used on passwords.  The has is no longer a crackable MD5 hash, but a salted hash made
from AES-256 and Whirlpool and the password is password expanded 5,000 times!  In addition, only a portion of the hash is stored in the DB.  This makes it impractical
for hackers to try to obtain password hashes from your DB.  Reworked Manager will be using the same hashing, so you'll only need people to reset their passwords once.

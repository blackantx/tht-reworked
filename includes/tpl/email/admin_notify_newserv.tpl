A user has had their account upgraded to a plan on a new server just now.  The account on the old server still exists so they can migrate their website to the new server.  Please note that the old account will remain open until you remove it.  This will allow the client to be given enough time to move their website to the new server.<br>
<br>
<b>User who upgraded:</b> %USER%<br>
<br>
<b>New hosting plan:</b> %NEWPLAN%<br>
<b>Old hosting plan:</b> %OLDPLAN%<br>
<br>
<b>New Server:</b> %NEWSERVER%<br>
<b>Old Server:</b> %OLDSERVER%<br>
<br>
This is effective immediately.

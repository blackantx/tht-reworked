Your hosting account package has now been changed and this email contains all the information you will need in order to begin using your account.<br>

If you are using your own domain name that you entered during sign up then your site may not be visible on the internet for between 24 and 72 hours. This process is called Propagation. Until your domain has propagated your website and email addresses will not function, we have provided a temporary url which you may use to view your website and upload files in the meantime.  If your nameservers entered at your registrar are not the ones listed below, then this will apply to your upgrade.<br>

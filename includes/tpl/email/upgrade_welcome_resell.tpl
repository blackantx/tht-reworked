Your hosting account package has now been changed and this email contains all the information you will need in order to continue using your account.<br>
<br>
If you are using your own domain name that you entered during sign up then your site may not be visible on the internet for between 24 and 72 hours. This process is called Propagation. Until your domain has propagated your website and email addresses will not function, we have provided a temporary URL which you may use to view your website and upload files in the meantime.  This only applies if you changed your plan very soon after you signed up.<br>

<br>
1. Click on 'Create a New Account' from the left hand side menu<br>
2. Put the domain in the 'Domain' box (no www or http or spaces, just domainname.com). After putting in the domain, hit TAB and it will automatically create a username. Also, enter a password for the account.<br>
3. Your package selection should be one that you created earlier<br>
4. Then press the create button<br>
<br>
This will give you a confirmation page. (You should print this for your records.)<br>
